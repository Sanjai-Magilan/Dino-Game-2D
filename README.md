# Dino-Game-2D
A Superior Version of the Google Dinosaur Game 🦖🎮

You know that cute little dinosaur you play with when your Wi-Fi decides to take a coffee break? Forget it. This is the next level. Built with a sprinkle of inspiration (and a hefty dose of tutorial-watching), this game is everything you didn’t know you needed. Sure, I followed a tutorial and gave credit where it's due, but hey—small tweaks, big upgrades!

How to Run This Masterpiece:

1.Install Godot
  Make sure you have Godot 4.3 or higher. If you don’t, what are you even doing here?

2.Clone This Repo
  Get this repository on your system. Do not—I repeat, do not—rename any folders or files unless you enjoy debugging your life away. 
  If you must rename something, remember to update every instance in the scene's scripts too (good luck with that).

3.Run It in Godot
  Open the project in Godot, click the play button, and boom—you’re running the game.


A Heads-Up About High Scores 🏆
When you first start the game, there’s no fixed high score. It’s a clean slate, waiting for your legendary run. 
Make it count! (Or just crash immediately—it’s your call.)
